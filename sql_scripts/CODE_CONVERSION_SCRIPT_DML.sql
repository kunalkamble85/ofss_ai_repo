3. Validated data is stored in the staging database.
4. A scheduled job picks data from staging, transforms it, and loads it into the warehouse.
5. BI tools query the warehouse for dashboards.

## Detailed Component-wise Data Processing

- **Frontend**  
  - Captures user input and sends it via HTTP POST.
  
- **Backend API**  
  - Validates and enriches incoming data.
  - Pushes valid records to the staging table.

- **ETL Processor (Airflow)**  
  - Triggered every hour.
  - Performs joins with reference data.
  - Applies transformations (e.g., normalization, data type conversions).
  - Loads transformed data into the Snowflake data warehouse.

- **Data Warehouse (Snowflake)**  
  - Stores curated and historical data.
  - Used as a source for reporting and analytics.

## Data Transformation Logic

- **Normalization:** Input values are standardized (e.g., date formats).
- **Derived Columns:** Calculated fields like `risk_score = weight * volatility`.
- **Anonymization:** Personally identifiable information is masked before loading into the warehouse.

## Trigger & Schedule Information

- **ETL Job:** Hourly via Apache Airflow
- **Alert Notification:** On ETL failure, Slack and Email alerts are triggered.

## Notes

- CDC is implemented on the source to track changes.
- Retry logic with exponential backoff is configured in case of data pipeline failures.')
